# About 'Headliners' project

This project is based on the part of the book "Flask By Example" by Gareth Dwyer.
So, that's a web-app where you can find currency ratings, weather and news.
I tried to record each step in repo, so you can see, how this app was builded.

# Building

- Clone this repo
- Check that you have python 2.7 (or go to venv or something with python 2.7)
- In console go to the project folder and then write "python headlines.py"
- Press return
- ...
- PROFIT!!! (I suppose)
